Computing for Sustainable Urban Environments, Spring 2021

New York University

Tandon School of Engineering

Brooklyn, NY

Instructor: Avigail Vantu avigailvantu@nyu.edu

Location: online

### Course Description

Throughout the past several decades more and more people have chosen to live in cities. Along with benefits like increased efficiency and economic prosperity, urban growth has also introduced new challenges in cities like air pollution, waste management, food disparities, traffic congestion, housing inequalities, and access to public spaces.The use of data to understand such complex issues is becoming more and more common nowadays. Academic circles, private companies, and the public sector all rely heavily on evaluations and decision-making informed by data.
This course will expose students to basic tools, methods, and resources which can be used to conduct applied investigations of sustainability in urban environments using data.
Throughout this course students will be exposed to basic tools, methods, and resources. Students will be asked to apply said tools and methods in data driven investigations on urban sustainability. The course will focus on hands-on learning of essential tools and programs to acquire, wrangle, analyze, and visualize geographical datasets (e.g. Jupyter Notebooks using Python & QGIS). Students will use critical thinking when using data for sustainable spatial analyses. For their final project, the students will choose a real publicly available dataset to investigate and answer a contemporary social or environmental problem.

### Learning Objectives

* Learn the fundamentals of theoretical sustainable cities computing methods for the US and global cities
* Learn how to apply data mapping tools to visualize urban and environmental related data
* Learn how to apply data analysis tools to answer research questions 1
* Learn how to acquire different types of publicly available datasets
* Learn how to apply critical thinking when working with spatial data

### Course Structure

The course will combine lectures, guest lectures, and class discussions (60-70%) and a lab section hands-on learning (30-40%). Students will be required to bring their laptops to class and complete class assignments using technologies and tools learned in class. During the lab section, students will be asked to apply the tools on their own laptops. No prior knowledge of coding or mapping tools is required. However, a basic understanding of statistical terms and regression analysis will be assumed.

This repo contains the lab materials for the Computing for Sustainable Urban Environments class at NYU Tandon for Spring 2021.

Throughout the semester more materials will be added. In addition, to markdowns (.md files) data, code and images will added here. In other cases you will be requested to download the data for an assignment directly from an open data platform.

At the end of each assignment there would be a mention of the deliveries. Submissions, unless otherwise is detailed, will be done through NYU Classes. ''
